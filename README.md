1. **Get Started**: :slightly_smiling_face:

   1. Open the `statistical_learning.Rproj` using RStudio.
   2. Download: required Library:
      1. `ISLR` : For general statistical learning algorithm support. 
      2. `randomForest` :Provide complete implementation of random forest Algo. 
      3. `neuralnet` : Provide Complete implementation of neural network and plotting tools.
      4. `gbm ` : Provide Complete implementation of Many Boosting Method including GBDT.
      5. `pls ` : Provide Complete implementation of Principle component analysis.
      6. `e1071` : Provide Complete implementation of SVM.
      7. `DMwR ` : Provide relatively complete implementation of SMOTE data augmentation algo.
   3. The main data are stored in `On_stage_data2.csv` in the root folder of this repo.

2. Explanation:

   1. The detailed outcome might be different from the report since in the report, models are trained separately with different random number seeds.

   2. Report and Poster are available: [here]"https://github.com/Ericcsr/Group-3354/blob/master/supplimentry%20docs/Report_COMP3354.pdf"
